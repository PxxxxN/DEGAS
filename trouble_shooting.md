### Frequent trouble shooting steps
If you cannot follow the examples provided on github  
please check the following.  
  
Open the terminal on your computer.
  
Check for python 3 on your computer:  
``$python3``   

If python 3 is available on your computer you will  
see the prompt when it starts:  
``>>>``  
  
If you do not see the prompt, python 3 must be  
installed.  
  
If python starts, check for the tensorflow package:  
``>>>import tensorflow as tf``  
``>>>tf.__version__``  

If a version number appears then tensorflow is  
installed on your computer. If not, then tensorflow  
needs to be installed.

The same can be performed in python for the other
required packages numpy, math, and functools.  
``>>>import numpy as np``  
``>>>np.__version__``  
``>>>import math as mt``  
``>>>mt.__version__``  
``>>>import functools as ft``  
``>>>ft.__version__``  
  
If version numbers appear after the following  
python code, then the packages are installed.  
Otherwise install them with pip3 from terminal.  
  
``$pip3 nameofpackage``
