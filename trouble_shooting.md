If you cannot follow the examples provided on github  
please check the following:  
  
Check for python3.X on your computer:  
``$python3``   

If python 3.X is available on your computer you will  
see the prompt when it starts:  
``>>>``  

If python starts, check for the tensorflow package:  
``>>>import tensorflow as tf``  
``>>>tf.__version__``  

If a version number appears then python3 and tensorflow  
are installed on your computer.
